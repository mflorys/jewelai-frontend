TASK FOR CURSOR: Build a minimal Next.js frontend for JewelAI using the backend API described below. 
Use Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, React Query (or TanStack Query) and Tailwind CSS.
Visual style: premium jewelry brand – black, white, soft beige, gold accents, thin serif fonts for headings, clean sans-serif for body text.
Very important: DO NOT use the word "quiz" in any user-facing text (no labels, buttons, headings). In the code you may use "quiz" in types/interfaces if needed, but never in visible copy. Use wording like "design questions", "style preferences", "short questionnaire", "project setup" etc.

========================================
1. GLOBAL UX CONCEPT (MINIMAL NAVIGATION)
========================================
The app has exactly three top-level user experiences:

1) Login
   - Screen for entering email + password.
   - After successful login, user is redirected to the Projects (dashboard).

2) Projects (Dashboard)
   - Single page where user:
     - sees all their projects (design processes),
     - can select a project and see its current status + basic info,
     - can start a new project (opens the "create project" flow),
     - can continue the "design questions" flow for a project that is still in the intake stage.
   - This is a single screen; do NOT create a separate top-level navigation item for project details. 
     Project details can be shown in a right-side panel or a sub-view on the same page.

3) Create New Project (One-question-per-step flow)
   - A guided, step-by-step flow where user answers design questions for the new project.
   - One question per step (single screen at a time).
   - After finishing all questions, the backend sets the process status to READY_FOR_GENERATION automatically.
   - From the user’s perspective, this is "New project setup", not a "quiz".

You are allowed to implement additional internal routes (e.g., /projects/[id]) if needed for technical clarity, but the UX should feel like only these three main experiences exist.

========================================
2. BACKEND API CONTRACT (SUMMARY)
========================================

Auth: JWT Bearer, already handled by backend.

Key endpoints (all require Authorization header):

POST /api/processes
- Creates a new design process for current user.
- Response body: JSON with process object:
  { id, title, status, type, createdAt, updatedAt, ... }

GET /api/processes
- Returns a list of processes for current user.
- Each item: { id, title, status, type, createdAt, updatedAt, ... }

GET /api/processes/{id}
- Returns full details of a single process.

PUT /api/processes/{id}/title
- Body: { "title": "New title" }
- Renames a project.

GET /api/processes/{id}/status
- Returns minimal status info:
  { id, status, updatedAt, type, title }

POST /api/processes/{id}/start-generation
- Only valid if status == READY_FOR_GENERATION.
- Triggers external generation and sets status = GENERATION_REQUESTED.

POST /api/quiz/processes/{id}/answers
- Body: { "questionId": number, "answerJson": any-json }
- Saves or updates one answer for given process and question.
- When all active questions are answered, backend automatically:
  - sets process.status = READY_FOR_GENERATION
  - sets process.type based on the JEWELRY_TYPE answer (or "UNDEFINED").

GET /api/quiz/processes/{id}/answers
- Returns list of answers for the given process:
  [
    {
      "questionId": number,
      "questionCode": string,
      "answerJson": any-json,
      "answeredAt": timestamp
    },
    ...
  ]

There is also a QuizQuestion model and endpoints (not detailed here), but you can assume:
- we can fetch all active questions in a known order,
- each question has: id, code (e.g., "JEWELRY_TYPE"), questionJson (metadata for rendering).

========================================
3. NEXT.JS APP STRUCTURE
========================================

Use Next.js App Router with the following main routes:

/login
- Public route (no auth guard).
- Contains:
  - brand logo / wordmark "JEWELAI" (thin serif),
  - short tagline,
  - email and password fields,
  - "Sign in" button.
- On successful login, store JWT (e.g., in localStorage or HTTP-only cookie if we later add SSR) and redirect to /projects.

/projects
- Protected route (requires JWT; if missing, redirect to /login).
- This is the main dashboard for all projects.
- Layout:
  - Left side: list of projects.
  - Right side: detail area for selected project.

Left side:
  - Button: "Start a new project"
  - List of project cards:
    - Title
    - Status badge
    - Type (if available)
    - Last updated (e.g., "Updated 3 hours ago")

Right side (when a project is selected):
  - Project title (editable inline; on blur or on "Save", call PUT /api/processes/{id}/title).
  - Status badge (mapping of backend status to human-readable labels).
  - Type (e.g., "Ring", "Pendant" or "Not set yet").
  - Section "Design setup":
    - If status == INTAKE_IN_PROGRESS:
      - Show summary of answered questions (optional).
      - Show primary button: "Continue design questions".
      - Clicking this button opens the one-question-per-step flow for this project.
    - If status == READY_FOR_GENERATION:
      - Show explanation text and a primary button "Generate design preview".
      - Button calls POST /api/processes/{id}/start-generation.
      - After calling, start polling GET /api/processes/{id}/status.
    - If status == GENERATION_REQUESTED:
      - Show "Your design is being prepared..." message.
      - Poll GET /api/processes/{id}/status every few seconds.
    - If status >= VISUAL_READY:
      - Show visualization preview (when endpoint and visualizationUrl are available later).
      - Show possible follow-up actions (accept, send for review, etc. in the future).

Internally, you may implement an additional route such as:
/projects/[id] for the detail view, but UX navigation should still appear as a single “Projects” screen.

Create New Project flow:
Option A (simpler): When user clicks "Start a new project" on /projects:
  - Call POST /api/processes.
  - Redirect immediately to /projects/[newId]/design (or open a full-screen wizard overlay on top of /projects).
Option B: Direct route /projects/new that creates a process on first step.

You are free to choose one, but the UX must feel like:
- Click "Start a new project" on dashboard → user is taken into a guided question flow for that new project.

========================================
4. ONE-QUESTION-PER-STEP FLOW (NO "QUIZ" WORD)
========================================

Route example: /projects/[id]/design (or similar). This route is accessed when:
- User creates a new project, or
- User chooses "Continue design questions" for an existing project with status INTAKE_IN_PROGRESS.

Behaviour:
- Fetch current process via GET /api/processes/{id}.
- Fetch active questions (order defined by backend).
- Fetch existing answers via GET /api/quiz/processes/{id}/answers.
- Determine current step:
  - The first question without an answer,
  - or resume from first unanswered question in the sequence.

UI for each step:
- Show step indicator (e.g., "Step 2 of 7").
- Show question text and subtext based on questionJson.
- Render appropriate input control depending on questionJson:
  - Single choice buttons
  - Radio list
  - Text input
  - Select, etc.
- Primary button text should be something like:
  - "Next"
  - "Continue"
  - "Save and continue"
- For the final question, button text: "Finish setup".

Saving an answer:
- On click of primary button, call:
  POST /api/quiz/processes/{id}/answers
  with:
  {
    "questionId": currentQuestion.id,
    "answerJson": <structured JSON from the UI>
  }
- After success:
  - Move to the next question.
  - If that was the last question:
    - Backend will automatically set status = READY_FOR_GENERATION.
    - Redirect user back to /projects.
    - On /projects, highlight the newly completed project as "Ready to generate".

IMPORTANT TEXT CONSTRAINT:
- Never show the word "quiz" in any title, description, or button label.
- Use alternatives like:
  - "Answer a few design questions"
  - "Project setup"
  - "Jewelry preferences"
  - "Style questionnaire"
  but not literally "quiz".

========================================
5. STYLE & THEME (PREMIUM JEWELRY BRAND)
========================================

Implement a design system consistent with:
- Background: soft warm off-white / light beige for main background.
- Primary text: near-black.
- Accent color: gold (#D4AF37-like tone) for borders, badges, and highlights.
- Secondary dark surfaces: pure black or very dark charcoal for key hero areas.
- Fonts:
  - Serif (thin, elegant) for large headings and logo (e.g., "JEWELAI").
  - Clean sans-serif for body text and labels.

Use Tailwind to define:
- Custom colors: background, surface, gold, text-main, text-muted.
- Border radius: subtle, 12–16px.
- Soft shadows for cards, especially project cards and modals.

Key UI components:
- Primary button (solid black with white text and subtle gold hover).
- Secondary button (white with gold border).
- Status badge:
  - INTAKE_IN_PROGRESS → "Design in progress", neutral
  - READY_FOR_GENERATION → "Ready to generate", gold accent
  - GENERATION_REQUESTED → "Generating…", neutral with spinner
  - VISUAL_READY → "Preview ready", gold accent
  - others → minimal labels (can be added later)

========================================
6. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
========================================

State management:
- Use React Query for:
  - fetching process list
  - fetching single process
  - fetching status (with polling)
  - fetching questions and answers
  - mutations for:
    - create process
    - save answer
    - update title
    - start generation

API client:
- Create a small wrapper around fetch or axios:
  - automatically adds Authorization: Bearer <token> from storage
  - parses JSON
  - throws normalized errors

Auth guard:
- Implement a simple hook/useEffect at the layout level for /projects and children:
  - if no token → redirect to /login.

Error handling:
- For 401/403:
  - show message and redirect to /login.
- For other errors:
  - show inline toast or error box at the top of the screen.

Responsiveness:
- On mobile:
  - Projects list should be a vertical list with ability to tap a project and expand details below.
  - New project flow should be full-screen, single column.

Assets:
- Use existing premium-style dashboard concept image as inspiration only.
- Do not hard-code any base64 images in components; static assets should live in /public and be referenced via standard Next.js asset paths.

========================================
7. DELIVERABLES
========================================

Cursor, please:
1) Initialize a Next.js App Router project with TypeScript and Tailwind.
2) Implement:
   - /login page
   - /projects page (including embedded detail view)
   - /projects/[id]/design or equivalent route for one-question-per-step flow.
3) Implement API client, React Query provider, auth token storage and guards.
4) Implement all UI strictly following the premium jewelry style and text constraints (no "quiz" in UI).
5) Keep the codebase clean, modular, and ready for future expansion (e.g., visualization preview, admin view).

Backend is up and running on http://localhost:8080
