TASK: Update Next.js frontend to support new backend structure and comment editing rules.

CHANGES REQUIRED:

1️⃣ USE NEW ENDPOINT FOR LOADING PROJECT DATA
- Replace multiple fetches with a single call to:
  GET /api/processes/{id}/details
- Returned fields include:
  id, title, status, type, createdAt, updatedAt,
  additionalComment, visualizationUrl, answers[]

Front-end should store these in local state:
{
  title,
  status,
  additionalComment,
  visualizationUrl,
  answers
}

2️⃣ ADD COMMENT TEXTAREA TO PROJECT DETAILS PAGE
- Add a textarea labeled "Your note"
- Pre-fill with additionalComment from API
- Local state: const [comment, setComment] = useState(project.additionalComment ?? "")
- Show character limit 500 (optional UI hint)
- If comment is empty → treat as null when saving

3️⃣ ENABLE EDITING ONLY WHILE STATUS < GENERATED
- If project.status is "READY_FOR_GENERATION" or earlier → textarea enabled + Save button visible.
- If project.status >= "GENERATED" → textarea disabled and Save button hidden.
- Use numeric order if mapping enum to UI is needed.

Logic:
const isEditable = ["INTAKE_IN_PROGRESS","READY_FOR_GENERATION","GENERATION_REQUESTED"].includes(project.status)

4️⃣ SAVE COMMENT WITH PATCH
PATCH /api/processes/{id}/comment
Body:
{ "comment": comment }  // send null or "" to clear

After save:
- Show toast "Saved"
- Refetch process details from /details OR update local state only.

5️⃣ UI BEHAVIOR
- Save button disabled if no changes
- While saving → show spinner
- After save → disable spinner + confirm toast

6️⃣ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- Comment loads from backend correctly
- Can edit and save before image is generated
- Cannot edit after image exists OR status >= GENERATED
- Page uses only GET /details for loading initial data
